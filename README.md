# [vkxml](https://docs.rs/vkxml)

[Documentation.](https://docs.rs/vkxml)

**vkxml** is a [Serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde) Rust representation of the `vk_new.xml` file generated by https://github.com/NicolBolas/New-Vulkan-XML-Format.

**vkxml** has been made for use with [serde-xml-rs](https://github.com/RReverser/serde-xml-rs) and, because of some quirky attributes required by serde-xml-rs, most likely will not work with any other serde xml parser.

## Usage

To get started, you'll need a copy of `vk_new.xml` which you can easily generate by following the directions on [New-Vulkan-XML-Format](https://github.com/NicolBolas/New-Vulkan-XML-Format). `vk_new.xml` is a lossless, reformatted version of Vulkan's `vk.xml` into something that's easier to parse.

After that, you can create your Rust project:

`Cargo.toml`
```toml
[dependencies]
serde-xml-rs = {git = "https://github.com/RReverser/serde-xml-rs.git"}
vkxml = {git = "https://github.com/terrybrashaw/vkxml"}
```

`main.rs`
```rust
extern crate serde_xml_rs;
extern crate vkxml;

fn main() {
    let xml = std::fs::File::open("vk_new.xml").unwrap();
    let spec: vkxml::Registry = serde_xml_rs::from_reader(xml).unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", spec);
}
```
